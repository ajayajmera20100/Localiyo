## Problem Statement :
We already have multiple news websites available in market but sometime the news 
are inappropriate or irrelevant to us. 
There are number of such websites which provides news but are unable to fullfil the 
need of users because they donâ€™t provide the news related to their locality for which 
the users are generally interested.
Many users who uses popular news websites have suggested that sometimes the 
news displayed over there is not so much relevant to them as it doesn't provide 
them updates and news related to their vicinity.

## Objectives :
- To provide local updates to user.
- To help user know their area better.
- To provide a platform for user to share updates in their vicinity.
- To help users to connect & discuss with other people.
- To provide authenticated news.

## Tech Stack

- MongoDB as Database
- Express and NodeJS for Backend
- HTML, CSS, Handlebars, JavaScript and Bootstrap for Frontend
- News API to fetch the latest news.
